# Shortest Path and Hash Function Analysis:
This project includes two main programs that showcase fundamental concepts in algorithms and data structures.

## 1. Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm
Description: This Java program finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm. The user inputs a start and end node, and the program calculates the minimum distance and path between the two nodes.
Features:
Allows the user to input start and end nodes.
Utilizes priority queues to ensure efficient pathfinding.
Displays the shortest path and distance between the nodes.
## 2. Hash Text Analysis
Description: This program reads a text file, hashes each word, and stores it in a hash table. It then performs various analyses on the hash table to study hash collisions, clusters, and empty spaces.
Features:
Hashes each word from the input text file using a custom hash function.
Handles collisions with linear probing.
Outputs statistics about filled slots, longest empty spaces, clusters, and word distribution.
## What I Learned:
#### Dijkstra’s Algorithm:
Graph Representation: Learned how to represent a graph using an adjacency matrix and implement Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path calculations.
Priority Queues: Improved my understanding of priority queues and their role in implementing efficient pathfinding algorithms.
#### Java Basics: Practiced using loops, if-statements, and arrays to ensure the program runs effectively.
Hash Function Analysis:
Hash Functions: Explored the process of hashing text data and how to manage collisions in a hash table using linear probing.
Text Processing: Gained experience with Java’s file handling and text processing, especially converting text to lowercase and removing special characters.
Statistics on Hash Table: Developed skills in analyzing hash tables by calculating metrics like longest empty space and biggest cluster.
